faq-section:
  answer-1: >-
    Unlike conventional voice assistants, Melli does not wait for instructions
    from its users, but proactively approaches them with activity suggestions.
    In this way, it motivates users to be more active in their daily lives, in
    which social contacts play an important role.
  answer-10: >-
    Currently, Melli cannot yet be actively addressed by the user. However, this
    function will follow in the coming months. Users will then be able to ask
    Melli to turn on the music or announce the weather for the coming days, for
    example.
  answer-2: >-
    Yes Melli is ideal for dementia patients, as it provides seniors with
    structure and orientation in everyday life through functions such as
    drinking and appointment reminders, alarm clocks, and medication schedules.
    It helps to establish a certain regularity and routines in the day, which
    can have a very positive effect on nutrition, for example. It can also
    compensate for cognitive impairments and train mental and physical fitness
    through small exercises.
  answer-3: >-
    Melli is simply operated by voice command and asks herself when what she
    needs to know something. As simple as a nice conversation.
  answer-4: >-
    All individual configurations such as medication schedules, interests,
    bedtimes and physical impairments can be easily set via the Melli app.
  answer-5: >-
    Via the Melli app, contacts selected (by the administrator) can get in touch
    with the user, e.g. via video or voice call. This way, the entire family can
    participate in the Melli functions.
  answer-6: >-
    The Melli app has two functions. On the one hand, appointments can be
    scheduled and important information about the user can be provided (e.g.
    hobbies, interests & physical impairments). On the other hand, the app
    serves as an interface between relatives and the Melli users, because
    friends and relatives can use it to contact the users via video or audio
    telephony, for example.
  answer-7: "Melli users do not have unrestricted access to the Internet. Melli moves online only in defined and checked spaces and cannot leave them even on the user's command. In addition, Melli operates according to the highest data protection standards. It is DSGVO compliant and uses the data provided to it exclusively to design a personalized user experience.\L You can find out more about data protection"
  answer-8: >-
    Although Melli provides some security features, such as emergency contacts
    the knock-in call, it should by no means be considered a complete
    replacement for a security system.
  answer-9: >-
    Of course, Melli can be transported without any problems. The only thing to
    note is that the SIM card only works like this within Germany and that Melli
    has a stable Internet connection.

      With Melli, laziness doesn't stand a chance in everyday life. She ensures
      a regular daily routine, wakes her users in the morning and always
      remembers to take their medication and drink. She also keeps track of
      every doctor's appointment and every date. Melli users are thus better
      able to manage their daily lives independently without having to rely on
      outside help.

      Melli entertains her users with all kinds of exciting media content. She

      Before Melli arrived at my place, I had some jitters. Not that I still
      break the device. But that was great! I got everything explained over the
      phone and you can't do anything wrong either. I just have to talk to
      Melli, very simple.
    quote-2: >-
      I was very excited when I got Melli. It was very new for me, such a
      technical device. But in the meantime I have gotten used to her. I like
      the puzzles best and when she plays music for me.
    quote-3: >-
      Many of the users' children and grandchildren noticed that grandma &
      grandpa talked a lot more about their everyday lives and also spoke much
      more positively. This has probably given the conversations a whole new
      quality.

    No, participation in the test user program is free of charge. However, we
    are of course happy to receive regular feedback and suggestions for
    improvement.
  answer-10: >-
    In the future, appointments and reminders will be able to be set via the
    Melli app. The app is currently still in the development phase and will be
    made available to users at a later date. It will also be possible to enter
    interests, bedtimes and medication schedules, for example. This will enable
    Melli to adapt to the needs of its users in the best possible way.
  answer-2: The test phase usually lasts three months.
  answer-3: >-
    Currently, Melli cannot be used with WLAN. To ensure a stable Internet
    connection during the test, Melli is equipped with a SIM card with unlimited
    mobile Internet. Later, Melli will also be able to connect to its own WLAN.
  answer-4: No, the data volume is not limited.
  answer-5: >-
    Currently, telephony is not yet possible via Melli. However, this will be
    implemented in the coming weeks and months. It will then be possible to call
    contacts or other Melli users via Melli and selected contacts will be able
    to call Melli.
  answer-6: >-
    For the time being, this will not be possible. With our included devices, we
    want to ensure a certain quality standard for the users. This means that we
    want to make sure that Melli can best understand what the user is saying
    through a good microphone and that she is equipped with a speaker that can
    achieve a reasonable volume.

    Of course, Melli can be transported without any problems. The only thing to

      content from the Internet, and ensures a structured daily routine. In this
      way, it counteracts a lack of drive and brings more satisfaction into
      everyday life.
  feature-2:

    title: Melli structures and organises.
    description: >-
      With Melli, laziness doesn't stand a chance in everyday life. She ensures
      a regular daily routine, wakes her users in the morning and always
      remembers to take their medication and drink. She also keeps track of
      every doctor's appointment and every date. Melli users are thus better
      able to manage their daily lives independently without having to rely on
      outside help.
  service-3:
    title: Melli entertains. Access to podcasts, YouTube & Co.
    description: >-
      Melli entertains her users with all kinds of exciting media content. She
      creates personalized playlists and knows exactly which audiobooks will go
      down well with her users. This way, even less tech-savvy seniors get the
      chance to participate in the digital world and grandma and grandpa can be
      just as up-to-date as their beloved grandchildren.
